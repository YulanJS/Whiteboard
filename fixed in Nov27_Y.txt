1.Make knobs of non-selected shape hidden. Changed the draw method of each DShape.
Make new added shape as the selected shape, which is the same as our teacher's jar file.
Click a point outside of any shape, should set selectedShape to null.
2.Previously, press a point not in any shape, can still move the selected shape. Now, it is fixed by updating
setSelectedShape.
3.Changed some details and implementation of addShape, mouseListener, mouseMotionListener, setSelectedShape. 
Just overwrite all these methods please if it doesn't create conflict with your work. 
new method: setNewAddedShapeSelected()

Remaining: please check set color related to selected shapes to make sure they are working.
	If you find any issue with indexOfSelected or selectedShape, tell me please.

Be careful: indexOfSelected can be -1. SelectedShape can be null. These values indicate that there is no selected
shape now.
